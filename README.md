 * Snake, apple and wall classes were created. It was determined which keys would be pressed on the keyboard to move the snake within the sections of the game.

* The value of the random x and y value was determined by the location of the apple object. When the snake object hit the apple, the apple object was formed again. The code necessary for the snake to grow in size was written and deleted from the list at the end to make the neck grow longer.

* Score information was given on the screen.
